# Project Details

This project is a math application that caters to students, teachers, administrators, and parents. Teachers can assign questions to students, students can answer questions and check their responses, parents can monitor their student's progress, and administrators can add new content to the site, such as new students, classrooms, questions, teachers, or parents. Our application also provides feedback on student performance through individual reports and a leaderboard. It aims to offer comprehensive information to parents and teachers, enabling them to better support their students' development. 

From the home page, a user can navigate to a section that fits their persona so if they are a student they can navigate to the questions page and select and answer questions or view the leaderboard, if they are a parent they can see their student's progress, if they are a teacher they can make/edit assignments as well as see student progress, and if they are an administrator they can enter the site and add/edit/delete students, classrooms, teachers, or questions. The goal of the application is to help students learn math with adequate support and we believe this provides adequate resources to accomplish this goal.
